# pyside-pyday21

The material included in this repo was created for the PyDay BCN 2021 meeting (https://pybcn.org/events/pyday_bcn/pyday_bcn_2021/).
The code content is a "fork" with some toppings of https://github.com/cmaureir/qtforpython_workshop repo, created by @cmaureir, so if you find it useful give kudos to him :).

The aim of the workshop included in this report is to generate a "Christmas expenses" program, to record all the expenses derived from Christmas (dinners at home, dinners outside, presents,...). 
The different steps to create a "Christmas expenses" book are ennumerated from 01 to 06. All the code added on each step was marked with a comment.

## How to use it?
Install PySide6 from pip:
```pip install PySide6```
And execute the different steps just typing in the terminal:
```python 01-fist_execution.py```

As it is a GUI example, it will not work in docker containers, WSL2 consoles and similar environments.
